     This site is dedicated to a beauteous boy named Bubba. 
     Hair darker than the linux terminal background and
     promoter of rubber duck debugging, he is the self-monikered
     Coding Ferret. Often confused for a pyschology major,
     his way with words is at the unrivaled level of a 3rd grader.
     A gym savant and Five Guys lover, many believe he will undoubtedly
     not become the next Chris Martin. 
     lighter than a macbook air
