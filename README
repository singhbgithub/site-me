About
-----
This project is meant to create my personal website. I'm using scrum and 
test driven methodologies to drive feature development. This project is a means
to learn more about the web, how front-end and back-end interact, multi-
threaded applications, asynchronous applications, build tools, and networks.
Furthermore, I will explore 3rd party libraries and frameworks to get a feel
for the pros and cons.

This project starts out using netty (server), mysql (back-end), and bootstrap (front-end).

Once a stable version of the project is released, new projects will be created to explore other MVC's with alternate framework combinations.

Currently, the site is in development, and has not had a release yet.



Version Control Information
---------------------------
Using git, obviously.



Build Information
-----------------
Using ant.



Development Methodology
-----------------------
Scrum (well 'pseudo-scrum' since I'm the entire development team, scrum master, product owner, and only stakeholder)
Test-driven development (well not just yet, project isn't fully setup yet)



Project Setup
-------------
Go into the tools/ directory.
Read the README for setup instructions.



3rd Party Libraries
-------------------
ant - java build tool
log4j - java logging library
gson - google's json to java object
