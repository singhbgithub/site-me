ABOUT
-----

This directory will house tools that are meant to perform project specific tasks.
Primarily, this will house development environment setup scripts; it will also
house deployment scripts.

The web application can only be setup on Unix machines. Sorry Windows (not really).

Please make sure that the scripts have executable permissions.
